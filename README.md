# react-login-v2

This project contains Login/Registration components, including custom validation rules for registering and authenticating a user.
Upon logging in, the server provides a JWT Token to be provided in the header for future requests to authorized routes. I built this project
for practice, and to use it in future with a project I have in mind. I intend to implement this in future mobile web applications. 

## Usage

The components themselves, along with helper functions, can be imported as you please. Connect it to your backend (Demo backend is also contained), and it will issue JWT tokens in response to valid login requests.
